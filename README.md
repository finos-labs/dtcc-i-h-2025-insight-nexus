## Using DCO to sign your commits

**All commits** must be signed with a DCO signature to avoid being flagged by the DCO Bot. This means that your commit log message must contain a line that looks like the following one, with your actual name and email address:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

Adding the `-s` flag to your `git commit` will add that line automatically. You can also add it manually as part of your commit log message or add it afterwards with `git commit --amend -s`.

- **Architecture**: Powered by LLMs via AWS Bedrock, with a middleware layer (MCP Server) connecting to yFinance, Wikipedia API, and AWS RDS.
- **Interface**: Streamlit-based UI for an interactive, real-time experience.

### 2. GenAI MarketView

A real-time, AI-powered tool for in-depth stock analysis.

- **Purpose**: Generates LLM-based summaries of company overviews, historical performance, valuation, fundamentals, and trading signals using yFinance and Finnhub data.
- **Key Features**: Groups stock-related news into key themes for easy understanding.
- **Architecture**: Streamlit UI, AWS Bedrock LLMs, and JSON-based dynamic content generation.

### 3. Compliance Regulation Assistant Bot

An AI tool simplifying regulatory document analysis for legal, compliance, and financial teams.

- **Purpose**: Reduces time and errors in navigating dense compliance PDFs.
- **Key Features**:
  - ðŸ“„ **Document Summarization**: Concise AI-generated summaries.
  - ðŸ†š **PDF Comparison Tool**: Highlights changes between document versions.
  - ðŸŽ¯ **Impact Summary Generator**: Analyzes clause impacts on clients, companies, and investors.
